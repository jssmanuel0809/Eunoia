E-commerce website: Requirements for Applications Development & Empowerment Technologies Laboratory

Repository made after Midterms submissions.

Instructions:
Make sure Node and NPM are installed.
Run " npm start " in terminal.
Go to (http://localhost:3000) or (http://localhost:3000/login) on browser.
The website uses PostgresSQL to store and retrieve user information for authentication purposes.
If error occurs, go to the header.js file found in the components folder. On the last part of the js file, there is a line of code where "login" is commented. Comment all the following codes after it. You will be able to run the website normally, but the login.html and register.html will not be connected to the website and therefore, cannot be accessed through the website.
